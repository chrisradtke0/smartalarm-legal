            <strong>The short version:</strong> Smart Alarm processes your calendar and location data on your device to calculate wake-up and departure times. We do not sell your data, we do not track you, and we do not send your personal information to external servers beyond what is strictly necessary for core functionality (weather and traffic APIs).
        </div>

        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>Smart Alarm ("we," "our," or "the app") is developed by Christopher Radtke. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use the Smart Alarm iOS application. We are committed to protecting your privacy and being transparent about our data practices.</p>

        <h2>2. Information We Access</h2>
        <p>Smart Alarm accesses the following data on your device to provide its core functionality:</p>

        <table class="data-table">
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th>Data Type</th>
                    <th>Purpose</th>
                    <th>Storage</th>
                </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <td><strong>Calendar Events</strong></td>
                    <td>Read event titles, times, and locations to calculate optimal wake-up and departure times</td>
                    <td><span class="badge local">On-Device Only</span></td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><strong>Location (Precise)</strong></td>
                    <td>Calculate travel time to event destinations, detect arrival at events, and monitor for geographic movement between events</td>
                    <td><span class="badge local">On-Device Only</span></td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><strong>Location (Background)</strong></td>
                    <td>Detect arrival at event locations via geofencing and monitor overnight traffic conditions for alarm adjustments</td>
                    <td><span class="badge local">On-Device Only</span></td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><strong>Notification Preferences</strong></td>
                    <td>Deliver alarm notifications, departure alerts, and schedule briefings</td>
                    <td><span class="badge local">On-Device Only</span></td>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>

        <h2>3. External Services</h2>
        <p>Smart Alarm communicates with the following third-party services to provide core features:</p>

        <h3>Weather Data (OpenWeatherMap)</h3>
        <p>We send your event destination coordinates (latitude and longitude only — not your name, calendar data, or personal information) to the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve weather forecasts. This data is used to calculate weather-based buffers for your travel time. OpenWeatherMap's privacy policy is available at <a href="https://openweather.co.uk/privacy-policy" target="_blank">openweather.co.uk/privacy-policy</a>.</p>

        <h3>Route Calculation (Apple MapKit)</h3>
        <p>We use Apple's MapKit framework to calculate driving, transit, walking, and cycling routes between your location and event destinations. This processing is handled by Apple's services under Apple's privacy policy.</p>

        <h3>Subscription Management (RevenueCat)</h3>
        <p>We use RevenueCat to manage subscription purchases and entitlements. RevenueCat receives a pseudonymous user identifier and purchase receipts from the App Store. RevenueCat does not receive your name, email, calendar data, or location data. RevenueCat's privacy policy is available at <a href="https://www.revenuecat.com/privacy" target="_blank">revenuecat.com/privacy</a>.</p>

        <h2>4. Data We Do NOT Collect</h2>
        <div class="highlight-box">
            We do <strong>not</strong> collect, store, or transmit:
            <br>• Your name, email address, or account credentials
            <br>• The content of your calendar events (titles, descriptions, attendees)
            <br>• Your location history or movement patterns
            <br>• Device identifiers for advertising purposes
            <br>• Any data for third-party advertising or marketing
            <br>• Analytics or behavioral tracking data
        </div>

        <h2>5. On-Device Processing</h2>
        <p>The vast majority of Smart Alarm's processing happens entirely on your device. Calendar event analysis, wake-up time calculation, preparation time learning, event category classification, transition time estimation, streak tracking, and routine insights are all computed locally. Your data never leaves your device except for the specific external service calls described in Section 3.</p>

        <h2>6. Data Storage and Security</h2>
        <p>All persistent data (alarm settings, learned preparation times, route history, and preferences) is stored on your device using encrypted storage (iOS Keychain with <code>kSecAttrAccessibleWhenUnlockedThisDeviceOnly</code> protection) or local app storage. Sensitive data including cached locations and transition history is encrypted at rest and is not included in device backups.</p>
        <p>Location history older than 90 days is automatically purged from the device.</p>

        <h2>7. Family Tier and Household Profiles</h2>
        <p>The Smart Alarm Family tier allows creation of up to 6 household profiles within a single device. All household profile data (names, preparation times, preferences) is stored locally on the device. Household data is not synced to external servers or shared between devices.</p>

        <h2>8. Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>Smart Alarm is not directed at children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you believe a child under 13 has provided personal information through the app, please contact us and we will take steps to delete such information.</p>

        <h2>9. Your Rights and Choices</h2>

        <h3>Permissions</h3>
        <p>You can revoke calendar or location permissions at any time through iOS Settings. The app will continue to function with reduced capabilities (manual alarm setting) if permissions are revoked.</p>

        <h3>Data Deletion</h3>
        <p>Uninstalling Smart Alarm permanently deletes all data stored by the app on your device. There is no server-side data to request deletion of, as we do not maintain user accounts or cloud storage.</p>

        <h3>Subscription Management</h3>
        <p>Subscriptions can be managed or cancelled at any time through your Apple ID settings in the App Store.</p>

        <h2>10. Changes to This Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of material changes by updating the "Last Updated" date at the top of this page and, where appropriate, through an in-app notification. Your continued use of Smart Alarm after changes are posted constitutes acceptance of the revised policy.</p>

        <h2>11. Contact Us</h2>
