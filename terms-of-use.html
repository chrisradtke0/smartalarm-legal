    <div class="container">
        <div class="brand">Smart<span>Alarm</span></div>
        <div class="page-title">Terms of Use</div>
        <div class="effective-date">Effective Date: February 28, 2026 · Last Updated: February 28, 2026</div>

        <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
        <p>By downloading, installing, or using the Smart Alarm application ("the App"), you agree to be bound by these Terms of Use ("Terms"). If you do not agree to these Terms, do not use the App. These Terms constitute a legal agreement between you and Christopher Radtke ("Developer," "we," "our").</p>

        <h2>2. Description of Service</h2>
        <p>Smart Alarm is an iOS application that calculates optimal wake-up and departure times by analyzing your calendar events, real-time traffic conditions, weather forecasts, and personalized preparation routines. The App monitors conditions overnight and may adjust alarm times automatically based on changing circumstances.</p>

        <div class="warning-box">
            <strong>Important:</strong> Smart Alarm is a supplementary scheduling tool. It should not be used as your sole means of ensuring timely arrival for safety-critical, medical, legal, or emergency situations. The Developer is not responsible for missed events, flights, appointments, or any consequences arising from reliance on the App's calculations.
        </div>

        <h2>3. Eligibility</h2>
        <p>You must be at least 13 years of age to use Smart Alarm. If you are under 18, you represent that you have your parent or guardian's consent to use the App and agree to these Terms.</p>

        <h2>4. Account and Device Requirements</h2>
        <p>Smart Alarm requires an iOS device running iOS 17.0 or later. Certain features require you to grant permissions for calendar access, location services, and notifications. The App functions with reduced capabilities if permissions are not granted. No user account creation is required — the App operates entirely through on-device data.</p>

        <h2>5. Subscriptions and Payments</h2>

Your account will be charged for renewal within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period at the rate of your selected plan.</p>

        <h3>Free Trial</h3>
        <p>The Pro tier includes a 7-day free trial for eligible new subscribers. If you do not cancel before the trial ends, you will be automatically charged for the subscription. Free trial eligibility is determined by the App Store and is typically limited to one trial per Apple ID.</p>

        <h3>Cancellation</h3>
        <p>You may cancel your subscription at any time through your Apple ID settings (Settings → [Your Name] → Subscriptions). Cancellation takes effect at the end of the current billing period. You will retain access to paid features until the end of your current billing cycle. No refunds are provided for partial billing periods.</p>

        <h3>Price Changes</h3>
        <p>We reserve the right to change subscription pricing. Any price changes will take effect at the start of your next billing cycle following notice of the change. Continued use of the App after a price change constitutes acceptance of the new pricing.</p>

        <h2>6. Intellectual Property</h2>
        <p>Smart Alarm, including its design, code, features, algorithms, and documentation, is the intellectual property of Christopher Radtke. The background traffic monitoring and alarm adjustment technology is protected by a provisional patent filing ("System and Method for Dynamic Event-Based Circadian Scheduling and Continuous Background Revalidation"). You may not copy, modify, distribute, reverse engineer, or create derivative works based on the App.</p>

        <p>We do not warrant that:</p>
        <p>• The App will be uninterrupted, timely, secure, or error-free.</p>
        <p>• Wake-up time calculations, travel time estimates, or weather forecasts will be accurate.</p>

        <p>• The App will function correctly with all calendar providers, map data sources, or weather services.</p>

        <div class="warning-box">
            <strong>Alarm Reliability Notice:</strong> Smart Alarm uses iOS notification and background processing systems to deliver alarms. These systems operate on a best-effort basis as determined by iOS. Features such as Focus Mode, Do Not Disturb, Low Power Mode, and system resource management may affect alarm delivery. We strongly recommend maintaining a backup alarm for critical events.
